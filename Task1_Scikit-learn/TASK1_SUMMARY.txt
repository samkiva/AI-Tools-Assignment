✅ TASK 1 COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
├─ Test Accuracy:  93.33%
├─ Precision:      0.9345
├─ Recall:         0.9333
└─ Status:         ✅ PASSED (>85%)

METHODOLOGY:
├─ Algorithm:      Decision Tree Classifier
├─ Max Depth:      5 (prevents overfitting)
├─ Train/Test:     70/30 split
├─ Stratification: Yes (balanced classes)
└─ Random State:   42 (reproducibility)

INSIGHTS FOR YOUR REPORT:
1. Stratified splitting prevents class imbalance in train/test
2. Max depth constraint prevents overfitting
3. High precision/recall indicates balanced performance
4. Confusion matrix shows which species are confused
5. This classical ML approach works well for tabular data

WHY SCIKIT-LEARN IS GREAT HERE:
✓ Simple, interpretable results
✓ Fast training (instant)
✓ Perfect for structured/tabular data
✓ Easy hyperparameter tuning
✓ No GPU required

NEXT: Move to Task 2 (TensorFlow CNN for MNIST)
